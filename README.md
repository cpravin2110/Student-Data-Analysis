### 📊 Key Insights

**✔ Gender Distribution**

Nearly balanced dataset, with male and female students represented almost equally.

**✔ Ethnic Groups**

Groups A–E present; Groups C and D together make up 40%+ of the dataset.

**✔ Parental Education**

Students with highly educated parents showed 10–15 point higher Math averages.

**✔ Parental Marital Status**

Children from married households performed slightly better across subjects.

**✔ Subject Score Trends**

Median scores: 65–70 across Math, Reading, Writing with mild outliers.

**✔ Sports & Lifestyle**

50%+ of male students participate in sports — higher than females.

**✔ Study Hours**

Students studying 6–10 hrs/week score significantly higher.
