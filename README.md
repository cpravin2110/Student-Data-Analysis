🎓 Student Performance Analysis (EDA) with Python

An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focused on understanding how demographics, lifestyle, and family background affect students’ Math, Reading, and Writing performance.
This project provides insights that can help educators, parents, and policymakers understand factors influencing student success.


📁 Dataset

The dataset contains student-level information such as:

Gender

Ethnic Group

Parental Education

Parental Marital Status

Lunch type

Test Preparation

Study Hours

Sports Participation

Transport Mode

Subject Scores (Math, Reading, Writing)



🔍 Project Objectives

Perform thorough data cleaning & preprocessing

Explore relationships between student attributes and scores

Identify trends, patterns, and distributions

Visualize insights using Python libraries

Support data-driven educational decisions


📊 Key Insights

✔ Gender Distribution

Nearly balanced dataset, with male and female students represented almost equally.

✔ Ethnic Groups

Groups A–E present; Groups C and D together make up 40%+ of the dataset.

✔ Parental Education

Students with highly educated parents showed 10–15 point higher Math averages.

✔ Parental Marital Status

Children from married households performed slightly better across subjects.

✔ Subject Score Trends

Median scores: 65–70 across Math, Reading, Writing with mild outliers.

✔ Sports & Lifestyle

50%+ of male students participate in sports — higher than females.

✔ Study Hours

Students studying 6–10 hrs/week score significantly higher.
