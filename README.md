# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis (EDA) with Python

---
## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing student academic performance using Python Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify factors influencing Math, Reading, and Writing scores. The dataset includes demographic, lifestyle, and family background information to understand how different attributes affect student success.

The analysis reveals that average scores across subjects range between 65–70 marks, while students with highly educated parents scored 10–15 marks higher on average. Students studying 6–10 hours per week consistently achieved better performance, highlighting the importance of study habits and family background in academic outcomes.
